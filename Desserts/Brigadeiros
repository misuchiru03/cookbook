Feijoada (Traditional Brazilian Fudge Balls)

Ingredients:

* 1 (14 oz) can sweet condensed milk
* 4 tbsp cocoa powder, sifted
* 2 tbsp butter, plus more for rolling balls
* Pinch of salt (optional)
* Good quality chocolate sprinkles (or other sprinkles if you are adventurous)


Instructions:

1. In a small sauce pan, mix the sweet condensed milk, cocoa powder, butter, and salt (if you chose to use it).

2. Bring sauce pan to the stove and heat over medium-low heat. Too high and you will burn the mixture!

3. Cook it, constantly stirring to ensure it does not burn. Keep stirring until it thickens. If you can run your spatula or wooden spoon across the bottom of the pan and it takes the mixture a while to move, it's thick enough.

4. Take pan off the heat, let cool to room temperature.

5. Set aside a plate and dump the chocolate sprinkles on the plate for rolling the balls.

6. Once cool, grease your hands with butter and roll the brigadeiros mixture into balls, about the side of a half-tablespoon for each ball, but feel free to make them as big or little as you'd like).

7. Roll the brigadeiro balls into the sprinkles and place in paper or foil candy cups (similar to tiny cupcake/muffin cups).
