## Origin of this cookbook
I spent a lot of time with my mother and father in the kitchen. Looking back, I realize they taught me critical skills that allowed me to move-out and not rely on your standard college dorm dinners of top ramen; from food to cooking utensils, I learned to cook using all of my senses, which allows me to modify recipes as I see fit. After moving out and getting my own place, I reached-back to get some of the recipes my mother used, which her mother used, and so on. These recipes represent a part of my childhood I long for each time I return home to visit. I am putting this cookbook together to keep that same spirit alive and share it with everyone.
