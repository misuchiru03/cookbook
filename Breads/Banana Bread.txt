This is a quick recipe that start-to-finish takes about an hour. You will have an amazing banana bread that goes well with nuts or other optional toppings/additions. The generic recipe was borrowed and tweaked over several years. Enjoy.

Ingredients

Wet:
2-3 Medium (7" to 8" long) very ripe bananas, peeled (about 1.25-1.5 cups mashed)
1/3 cup (76g) salted or unsalted butter, melted
1 large egg, beaten

Dry:
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/8 tsp fine granulated salt
1 cup (200g) sugar (if you would like less sweet, 1/2-3/4 cup or 100-150g will do)
1 1/2 cups (205g) all-purpose flour
1/8 tsp ground cinnamon
1 Pinch of ground nutmeg
1/2 cup walnuts chopped (optional)
1 tsp vanilla extract


Instructions

1.  Preheat oven to 350째F (175째C) and line a 4x8 inch loaf pan with parchment (oil/butter can be used to adhere parchment paper to pan if desired)

2.  In a medium mixing bowl, mash the bananas together until completely smooth.

3.  Mix in melted butter to bananas until homogenous

4.  Mix in the baking soda, salt, beaten egg, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg until relatively homogenous

5.  Fold in the sugar and flour until not dry anymore, then mix thoroughly

6.  (Optional) Mix in nuts if desired

7.  Once batter is well-mixed, pour batter into prepared loaf pan. Place loaf pan in center of the oven, middle rack and bake for 50-60 minutes at 350째F (175째C) -- Oven temps and times may vary. Loaf should be browned on top, but not burned, and a toothpick inserted into the center (thickest part) of the loaf should come out clean. If the loaf is browned on top and the center is still wet, loosely tent foil over the loaf pan and bake until toothpick comes out clean.

8.  Remove from oven and let cool in pan for about 3-4 minutes. Extract the loaf from the pan using the parchment paper and set on a cooling rack to cool completely before slicing to serve.

9.  Once cooled sufficiently, slice and serve (a sharp bread knife works best here).


Storage

Wrapped well, the banana bread can last at room temperature for 4 days (mine never last more than 1 day). For longer storage, wrap well and refrigerate for 5 days, or freeze.

I used seran wrap to wrap the loaf tightly and prevent drying.
