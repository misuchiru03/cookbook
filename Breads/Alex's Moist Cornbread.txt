This is an easy sweet and moist cornbread that I typically serve during New Year's dinner with my Bacon and Kale Black Eyed Peas (located in Stews recipes). With a single serving, this recipe serves 12-16 with a decent-sized slice of cornbread.

Ingredients

Wet:
2 large Eggs
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 1/4 cup whole milk
4 tbsp melted salted butter

Dry:
1 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
2/3 cup cornmeal
1 cup sugar
1 tbsp baking powder
1/2 tsp kosher salt


Instructions:

1.  Preheat oven to 350째F (175째C) and butter or spray non-stick spray on a 9x13 glass baking dish (325째F (162째C). Additionally, you can line with parchment.

2.  In a large measuring cup, whisk together all wet ingredients.

3.  In a large bowl, whisk together all dry ingredients.

4.  While whisking dry ingredients, pour wet ingredients and mix until fully incorporated.

5.  Pour batter into baking dish and place in oven for 35-45 minutes (my oven took 35 minutes exactly, your oven times may vary). Cornbread is done when a toothpick is inserted in the center and comes out clean.

6.  Once done, remove from oven and let sit in baking dish for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, remove from dish and place on cooling rack to cool for another 5 minutes. If you cannot remove from baking dish, you can cut it in the pan and scoop out as need be.

7.  Serve with butter and or honey. Popular with Black Eyed Peas.
