Preparation

    1.
         1. Slice bacon strips thick and cook bacon over medium heat
	    until crisp and fat rendered. Add cooked bacon to slow
	    cooker, leaving fats and juices in pan to brown meats.
	 2. Sprinkle pork with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp ground black
	    pepper. Increase heat to medium-high. Add pork stew meat
	    to pan and saut√© until browned (approx 8 minutes). If
	    juice accumulates too much, spoon some out and keep browning.
	    Add to slow cooker.
	 3. Season neck bones with 1/8 tsp salt and a few grinds of
	    black pepper. Add neck bones to skillet, bone-side-down.
	    Brown the bones for 2-3 minutes each side, rotating to
	    cover all sides, including meat sides. Add to slow cooker.
	 4. Add drained beans, ham hock, onions, garlic, chicken broth,
	    1 tsp salt, coriander, bay leaves, and vinegar to slow cooker,
	    stirring to combine.
	 5. Cover and cook on low for 6 hours, or until beans and meat
	    are tender.
	 6. After cooking for 6 hours, check beans. If tender, spoon out
	    about 1/2 cup of beans and mash with fork or spoon until a
	    paste, similar to refried beans. Add back to slow cooker and
	    stir to combine. Repeat if needed to thicken to desired
	    consistency.
	 7. Cover and cook on low for 1 more hour.
	 8. Pull out bones and ham hock. Remove meat from bones, shred
	    with forks, and return to slow cooker.
	 9. Remove and discard bay leaves.
    2.
	 1. Cook rice as normal.
	 2. Slice oranges into rounds and then into wedges. Prep green
	    onions and cilantro.
