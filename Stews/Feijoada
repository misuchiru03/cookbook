Instructions:
1.  Slice bacon strips thick (about 1/2 inch) and cook bacon over medium to medium-low heat until crisp and fat rendered.

2.  Add cooked bacon to slow cooker, leaving fats and juices in pan to brown meats.

3.  Increase pan heat to medium-high.

4.  Sprinkle pork with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp ground black pepper.

5.  Add pork stew meat to pan and sear until browned (approx 8 minutes). If juice accumulates too much, spoon some out and keep browning.

6.  Remove pork stew meat when done and add to slow cooker.

7.  Season neck bones with 1/8 tsp salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Add neck bones to skillet, bone-side-down.

10. Add drained beans, ham hock, onions, garlic, chicken broth, 1 tsp salt, coriander, bay leaves, and vinegar to slow cooker, stirring to combine.

11. Cover and cook on low for 6 hours, or until beans and meat are tender.

12. After cooking for 6 hours, check beans. If tender, spoon out about 1/2 cup of beans and mash with fork or spoon until a paste, similar to refried beans.

13. Add mashed beans back to slow cooker and stir to combine. Repeat if needed to thicken to desired consistency.

14. Cover and cook on low for 1 more hour.

15. Pull out bones and ham hock. Remove meat from bones, shred with forks, and return to slow cooker.
