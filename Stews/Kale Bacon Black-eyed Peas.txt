My take on the traditional southern new year's dish. Pretty simple, can't really mess it up. Play with the recipe, but basic as is right now is good. Pairs well with Alex's Moist Cornbread.

Ingredients:

* 4 slices hickory smoked bacon
* 1 small red onion, peeled
* 1 15oz can regular black-eyed peas
* 1 15oz can black-eyed peas with jalapenos
* fresh cracked black pepper
* 8 oz kale
* 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar


Instructions:

1.  Rough chop bacon into 1/2 inch slices and place in a cold pan.

2.  Turn heat to medium-low and render bacon fat out, cooking until bacon bits are crispy but not dry.

3.  While bacon is rendering, thinly slice the red onion and add to bacon and rendered bacon fat, cooking and stirring to scrape-up fond from bottom of pan. Saute onions until softened.

4.  Add both cans of beans, freshly-cracked pepper (to taste), and add additional 1/2 can of water, turn up heat to high and bring to a boil.

5.  Allow to boil for about 5 minutes, then turn heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes to bring flavors together.

6.  If using fresh kale, remove thick stalks and tear into bite-size pieces and fold into the beans and bacon. Cover and cook for additional 5-10 minutes, based on your preference of crispiness of kale bits, adding more pepper if desired.

7.  Take out a wooden spoonful of the black-eyed peas and mash in a bowl, and replace into the pan, stirring around to thicken up the stew a bit (optionally you can mash them directly in the pan).

8.  Once at your desired consistency, remove from heat and stir-in 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar and serve immediately. Pairs well with Alex's Moist Cornbread.
