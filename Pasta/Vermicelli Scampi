		Serves 4
Ingredients

	1.
		+ 2 tablespoons olive oil
		+ 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
		+ 1/4 cup chicken stock
		+ 6 garlic cloves, minced (or 2 tablespoons minced garlic)
		+ 16 oz vermicelli or angel hair pasta
		+ 18 oz medium shrimp, raw, shelled, peeled, and tails off
		+ 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
		+ 2 tablespoons lemon juice
		+ 1/4 cup chopped parsley (or 2 tablespoons dried parsley)
		+ 1/4 cup chicken broth

Preparation

	1.
		1. Fill large pot with water. Liberally salt the water (should
		taste similar to ocean water, a little less than that is fine).
		Add olive oil to water if desired--a little extra flavor.

		2. Bring to boil.

		3. Add vermicelli to water and boil per package instructions
		(5-6 minutes should be around al dente)

	While pasta is cooking, make sauce.

	2.
		1. Place olive oil in a large skillet with 2 tablespoons of butter.
		Melt butter with oil until frothy on medium heat.

		2. Add garlic to pan and sauté until fragrant (about 30 seconds to
		1 minute). Do not burn garlic.

		3. Add shrimp to pan, season to taste with salt and pepper and sauté
		until just beginning to turn pink (about 1 to 2 minutes) then flip.

		4. Pour in broth, add crushed red pepper. Bring to a simmer (about
		medium-medium low) for about 3 minutes until broth reduces by about
		half. The shrimp should be just about cooked through (don't over
		cook shrimp--it turns rubbery if overdone).

		5. Stir in remaining butter (cubed), lemon juice, parsley and turn
		heat down to low.

		6. Cook down to desired thickness (shouldn't be terribly thick,
		just enough to stick to pasta)

	3.
		1. Remove 1 cup of pasta water to save for sauce and drain rest of
		pasta.

		2. Add 1/4 cup of pasta water and drained pasta to sauce.

		3. Stir pasta in sauce, mixing thoroughly, and bring to a simmer
		until sauce thickens and becomes less watery.

		4. Once desired thickness is achieved, take off heat and serve.
